  I am a Robotics PhD student at Georgia Institute of Techonology, working with professor [Sonia Chernova](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~chernova/).
  My research focuses on ***Semantic Reasoning for Robotics***.
  Specifically, I am interested in making robots that can operate in diverse and changing environments, such as hospitals and homes, by leveraging ***knowledge extraction***, ***representation***, and ***reasoning***.
  I am currently developing methods for reasoning with large-scale knowledge bases.

  Prior to joining the PhD program, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech.
